# Project Two: Words In Motion
by Juliana Tisker

## Project Overview

To me, community can be many different things, because we are a part of so many without even realizing. Community is a commonality that connects and brings people together, often times based on shared experiences or interests. There is so much you can learn and explore from your communities, from talking to your love ones, to joining an new extracurricular activity to meet new people, you can find community everywhere.

This project is all about the idea that self-care is the foundation for building strong, meaningful relationships. I chose this song because it speaks to me carries a powerful message that you have to take care of yourself before you can truly love and support those around you.

Thee Sacred Souls, a band I admire deeply because of the meeage they spread through their music and performances. Their music has this warm, soulful energy that brings me joy and helps me reflect. The lyrics in this particular song remind me of my own connection with my community, because when I'm feeling my best, I’m able to show up fully for the people I care about. That’s the feeling I wanted to bring into this project.

## Technical Overview

This project was built using HTML and CSS using Visual Studio Code and GitHub to create an interactive design where text is used as imagery. Different layouts, colors, sizes, spacing, and transformations will be used to empahsize the message within the lyrics.

Interactive elements will be carried out using transform properties such as scale, translate, skew, and rotate. Transition-duration will also be used to make sure there are smooth animations.
